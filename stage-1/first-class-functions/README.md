# Functions as First Class Objects

## What is a First Class Object?
The simplest explanation might be, an object behaves as though it is has a value, so that you can treat it _almost_ like any other variable. That is, you can create and destroy it (at runtime), you can pass it to functions, you can return it from functions, you can print it, you can store it in data structures (like arrays or objects).

## How are functions First Class?
Functions in JavaScript are said to be _first class objects_ because they fulfill the above criteria.

You can store references to functions in variables:
```js
var foo = function (a) {
  return a + 1;
};

// or

function foo (a) {
  return a + 1;
}
```

You can store references to functions in other data structures:

```js
var object = {
  foo: function (a) {
    return a + 1;
  }
};

// or

var foo = function (a) {
  return a + 1;
};

var object = {
  foo: foo,
};

object.foo(3); // gives 4
```

You can pass functions as arguments to functions:

```js
function foo (a) {
  return a + 1;
}

function apply (fun, num) {
  return fun(num);
}

apply(foo, 3); // gives 4
```

You can return a function from a function:

```js
function foo (a) {
  return a + 1;
}

function bar () {
  return foo;
}

var fun = bar();

fun(3);   // gives 4
bar()(3); // also gives 4
```

In JavaScript, the `Function` data-type is an instance of the `Object` data-type:

```js
function foo (a) {
  return a + 1;
}

foo instanceof Function; // gives `true`
foo instanceof Object;   // gives `true`
```

This means you can attach arbitrary attributes to functions:

```js
function foo (a) {
  return a + 1;
}

foo.bar = 2;
```

Note that identity of functions works the same way as identity of objects in JavaScript (because instances of `Function` are also instances of `Object`):

```js
var foo = function (a) {
  return a + 1;
};

var bar = function (a) {
  return a + 1;
};

var baz = foo;

foo == bar; // gives `false`
bar == baz; // gives `false`
foo == baz; // gives `true`
```


##Â Why is this useful?
First class functions are extremely useful because they allow you to (eventually):

* Create powerful abstractions that can help you work at a higher conceptual level, as opposed to worrying about implementation-level details all the time.
* Have clear separation of responsibilities between functions.
* Break-up and modularise code more easily (particularly asynchronous code)
